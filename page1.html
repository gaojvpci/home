				I love math because you can do so many useful things with it. For example I used Trigonometry in a <a href = "diep.io">diep.io</a> simulation program
				to rotate the tank and to shoot and move projectiles. I also like to solve problems in math because it gives me a sense of accomplishment and makes
				me feel smart. You can also use Calculus (or at least what I know of calculus) to calculate the area under a function, to, for example, 
				calculate the balance of a bank account where each y value is the amount of money deposited into the account at one time (by using lots
				and lots of rectangles and adding their areas).

				Now YOU do some Math! Here&rsquo;s a math question (Click the image to get the answer!):
