				My favourite subject is Math. It&rsquo;s one of the many things I&rsquo;m good at, but it&rsquo;s my strongest suit by far.
				I can pretty much do grade 12 math since I study Math when I have nothing to do at home, and I&rsquo;m planning to start Calculus after I 
				finish studying grade 11 and 12 math at Olympiads. You can find more info about Olympiads <a href = "https://www.olympiads.ca">here</a>.
				<br>
				<br>
				My Second favourite subject is Programming (not like HTML programming but like C++ programming (no offense)). I like Programming 
				because it&rsquo;s useful and smart. I especially love learning about algorithms that can solve problems like navigating a map and such.
				I&rsquo;m currently interested in Genetic Algorithms, where a random population is generated at the start and it basically "breeds" each
				member with another after "one lifetime" according to how they scored based on my standards. You can learn more about my programming interests
				<a href = "page3.html">here</a>.
				<br>
				<br>
				My favourite sport is soccer because it requires teamwork and strategy in order to score a goal. You need to have vision of the whole map
				and have good coordination with your teammates in order to make a good decision (that could affect the outcome of the match) In soccer it&rsquo;s never
				only about you; it&rsquo;s about your whole team. You can learn more about my opinions on soccer (and video games) <a href = "page2.html">here</a>.
				<br>
				<br>
				And finally, and arguably most importantly, the bibliography. The bibliography is a section of great importance, since if I don&rsquo;t 
				give credit to sources where it is due I will probably get bad marks for this assignment or worse. I just want to say that I really
				enjoyed this project and hope to make a web-game of my own someday.The bibliography can be
				accessed <a href = "page4.html">here</a>.
