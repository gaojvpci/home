			I LOVE soccer because it&rsquo;s strategic and  fast paced. You have to make decisions in seconds, all while being pressured by the enemy team.
			In this sense it is similar to a game I play, called <a href = "Paragon.com">Paragon</a>, which is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena that 
			simulates being in teams of 5 and fighting each other, taking objectives, and defeating enemy structures. I think this is similar to soccer because they are both competitive, 
			and force you to position yourself well and make smart decisions. Here&rsquo;s a list of the roles
			I play in soccer:
			<ol>
				<li><a href = "#strike">Striker</a></li>
				<li><a href = "#defend">Defender</a></li>
				<li><a href = "#mid">Midfielder</a></li>
			</ol>

			<h3 id = "strike">Striker</h3>
			Requires you to be good at dribbling, passing, crossing and shooting. You&rsquo;ll be running back and forth a lot so you need to be
			 in shape, or else you'll get tired fast.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3 id = "defend">Defender</h3>
			It&rsquo;s just like how it sounds; you need to defend against all attacks and play safe, but you also need to pass the ball to midfielders and 
			play offensively when necessary.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3 id = "mid">Midfielder</h3>
			You need to have great ball handling and passing skills to get the ball to other places and receive passes too. You also need 
			to do everything you can to stop the enemy's progression towards your side of the field.
