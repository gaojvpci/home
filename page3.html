				I really enjoy programming because, as mentioned earlier, I like making algorithms to solve questions on <a href = "dmoj.ca">DMOJ</a>
				and I also enjoy reading and learning about algorithms in books like <a href = "http://www.realtechsupport.org/UB/SR/algorithms/Cormen_Algorithms_3rd.pdf">this one</a>(
				only got to the middle of chapter 2 D: (It&rsquo;s hard to understand all the fancy words)).
				<br>
				Do you want a programming challenge? If so, try out <a href = "https://dmoj.ca/problem/3drotate">this</a> DMOJ question! It&rsquo;s not very easy, and I haven&rsquo;t solved it 
				yet either! (It's really complicated 3D rotations-stuff, so I can't do it. :P)
